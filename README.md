**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.  The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

Google uses this application to demonstrate how developers can modernize enterprise applications using Google Cloud products, including: [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Cloud Service Mesh (CSM)](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [Cloud Operations](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations), [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), [Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore), [AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb), and [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/). This application works on any Kubernetes cluster.

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Deploying to OpenShift

1. Create a new project 

   ```
   oc new-project online-boutique
   ```

2. Deploy the application

   ```
   oc apply -f kubernetes-manifests/

3. Expose the frontend service as a route

   ```
   oc expose svc frontend
   ```

4. Navigate to your frontend route in a web browser

   You can print the URL with the command: 

   ```
   echo "http://$(oc -n online-boutique get route frontend -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
   ```

   You will see something like the following:

   ```
   http://frontend-online-boutique.apps.local
   ```

   Navigate to the URL to see your Online Boutique homepage
